In an attempt to solve the multiple connected islands problem, connect (and it's associated sub-functions) are
now functions of the board class. This also freed up some space in Search.py. 

No luck though.

Currently moving generate moves and populate adjacent into the board...
- Generate moves:
    What's the significance of moves total? We import it as a global, then reassign it to be the length of the moves set.
    Can't this be done later? I'm assuming this is not important right now, and I can move this function into the board class.
- Populate Adjacent:
    This is within generateMoves()

There is a problem with connected islands, where WAY too many islands are being put into a connected islands list.
This is happening in connect. Here is a debug print statement from the first call.

==========================================
connecting:  [6, 6]  and  [6, 4]
same column
NodeA before: []
NodeB before: []
NodeA connected: [[6, 4], [6, 6]]
NodeB connected: [[6, 4], [6, 6]]
[6, 6] [6, 4]
=======================================================

Somehow, they ended up in eachother's connected islands lists. Worse yet, it's not just these two nodes that get into
eachother's connected list, but EVERY OTHER NODE (not just islands) on the board has these in their connected island list.

This happens again in the second call to connect, but it gets worse, as more islands get added.
==========================================
connecting:  [0, 6]  and  [6, 6]
same row
NodeA before: [[6, 4], [6, 6]]
NodeB before: [[6, 4], [6, 6]]
NodeA connected: [[6, 4], [6, 6], [6, 6], [0, 6]]
NodeB connected: [[6, 4], [6, 6], [6, 6], [0, 6]]
[0, 6] [6, 6]
=======================================================

When we there's an illegal board state (aka 1--1)...
    We need this to not happen.
        Connected islands can help us with this (or...?)

        However, connected islands is not being updated right for each node. This is apparent on the very first move.
